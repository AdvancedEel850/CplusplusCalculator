# Overview

I wrote software to demonstrate a basic calculator. This includes the basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I implemented the uses of files for a history of calculations you have done. This is done by reading and writing to a file that is created using the program.

I wanted to learn more about the c++ language as well as become more fluent in other programming languages. It provided a good challenge as well as an oppertunity to learn.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* I would like to add a feature that allows you to put in more then one function as a string, and makes it an infinite.
