# Overview

I wrote software to demonstrate a basic calculator. This includes the basic functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I implemented the uses of files for a history of calculations you have done. This is done by reading and writing to a file that is created using the program.

I wanted to learn more about the c++ language as well as become more fluent in other programming languages. It provided a good challenge as well as an oppertunity to learn.

I used C++ language, and the libraries I included were iostream and fstream, and using namespace std.

# Future Work

* I need to fix the input to not allow stings.
